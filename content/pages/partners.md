partnerDesc1: >-
  Our priority is to ensure that we enable youth from disadvantaged backgrounds to have the same opportunities as everyone else. Through 1-on-1 tutoring we believe that we can provide the tools inside  the classroom and out. We partnered with McMan, Mustard Seed, and USAY to deliver the best service that we can.
